I built this application using the MEAN(MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS) stack so all of them are needed to run the app. Hope that is okay.

To run the app, make sure Mongo is running and navigate to the project folder and run "nodemon server".

Once the app is running, you will be taken to the main page. There are 3 pairs of input fields for 3 names and their expenses. Enter a name into a box and enter an expense. Click the "Add expense" button to add that expense to the total for that person. Once you hit the "Add expense" button, the total beneath the name will be updated for that person. Continue adding expenses for that person until you have added all their expenses. The app is designed to take 3 students, two of which pay much less than the third, as it says in the prompt. 

Once you have entered 3 names along with their expenses, click the "Click here to calculate" button and you will be taken to the trip info page. The trip info page will display the total cost of the trip along with the highest spender's name and how much each of the other students owe the highest spender. There is a "Go back" button to go back to the main screen in the top left corner.
